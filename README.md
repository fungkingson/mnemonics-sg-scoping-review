# Conducting a Scoping Review of Studies Regarding Mnemonics Serious Games
Role: Researcher  
Duration: 8 months  
Project Type: Scoping review

## Problem Statement
Despite mnemonics and serious games both being increasingly used to improve learning due to their proven benefits, serious games about mnemonics have remained a rather niche topic. In particular, the structure and effectiveness of these “mnemonics serious games” in general has not been given much focus.

The goal of this project was to summarize and synthesize the characteristics and research findings of existing studies that primarily involved individual mnemonics serious games.

## My Role
Under a supervisor, I worked as a researcher. My responsibilities included gathering and screening papers, synthesizing insights, and proposing user-centered design solutions.

Due to academic restrictions, data and code used in analysis will not be shown. Rather, I will focus on describing the procedure, limitations, results, and implications.

## Research & Discovery
I conducted a scoping review of 12 papers describing studies about mnemonics serious games.

Research methods included:
- Gathering 729 papers and screening them based on PRISMA framework
- Summarizing each of the 12 papers that remained
- Creating characteristics with discrete values and seeing which value each game matched (e.g., Personal, Collaborative, or Hybrid for Game Mode)

The focus was on the details of the games' structure and mnemonics, as well as how effective the games were and to what extent they were utilized to teach mnemonic techniques.

## Limitations
Our scoping review had several limitations:
- Possible over-constraints from limiting to English and searching only four databases
- Subjectivity during screening could have led to filtering out relevant papers
- Subjectivity and biases during analysis could have affected results

These limitations meant that the review could not be taken as absolute and infallible.

## Insights
Our scoping review provided several issues with existing mnemonics serious games:
1.	The studies’ games were shelved rather than being released to the public
2.	Most of them force players to use mnemonics given by the game creators rather than letting them create their own
3.	They were not particularly memorable despite being enjoyable
4.	They mostly did not provide opportunities for collaboration

These showed that despite being found to have a positive effect, mnemonics serious games limit players’ freedom and do not have as much influence as hoped for.

## Goals
Based on the research findings, the following goals regarding mnemonics serious game were defined:
- Release mnemonics serious games to the public
- Allow players to create their own mnemonics for the game
- Make the game memorable in some way
- Allow players to interact with each other

## Proposed Solutions
### Research of Mnemonics Serious Games’ Long-Term Involvement in Academia
Incorporate mnemonics serious games into the curriculum of courses in various education levels, and research their long-term effects on students who use them.

**Rationale:** Involving them in academia allows them to influence multiple people and avoid being relegated to the short-term.

### Inclusion of Self-Created Mnemonics
Teach players how to create effective mnemonics, and incorporate these mnemonics into the game.

**Rationale:** Self-created mnemonics were found in prior research to be more effective, but there is also the risk of creating one of poor quality without proper teaching.

### Adding a Story and New/Unfamiliar Situations
Have a narrative in the game, and provide situations that the player would likely be unfamiliar with or not expect.

**Rationale:** Stories and surprising situations will help the game stand out, thus making it more memorable. Prior research also included these as characteristics of successful serious games.

### Multiplayer Modes
Allow players to either work together to solve problems (e.g., discuss answers to a question), or compete against each other (e.g., see who can provide the answer first).

**Rationale:** The opportunity to interact with other players has been shown to be beneficial to games in general, including serious games.

## Validation Strategy
If this project were continued, proposed solutions would be validated through:
- Finding papers involving these new solutions
- Conducting experiments involving these new solutions
- Analyzing them the same way the old ones were analyzed

## Reflection & Learnings
This project gathered the results of numerous studies about mnemonics serious games and compared them with each other. It strengthened my ability to seek out relevant papers for a given topic and synthesize their results to create generalized recommendations regarding this topic.

## Why This Project Matters
This scoping review demonstrates my ability to conduct research, identify issues with existing works, and propose thoughtful solutions. In addition, it gives an idea of how to improve mnemonics serious games so that they can help users learn better, which would certainly benefit them in the future.
